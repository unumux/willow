# **Willow-Button**

[Demo](http://codepen.io/team/UnumUX/pen/BWpzLa)

Buttons are used as triggers for actions. Depending on the use case, buttons contain a combination of a clear label and an icon. _Example actions may be to create, edit, delete, submit, etc._

Buttons can be created by adding the **willow-button** class to a `<button>` or `<a>` html element.

- `<button>` should be used for the user to accomplish something
- `<a>` should be used for the user to go somewhere
