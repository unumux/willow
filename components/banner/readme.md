# **Willow-Banner**

[Demo](http://codepen.io/team/UnumUX/pen/YZNzQM)

A banner is a highlighted area of a page used to call out a single piece of information or action. This area is typically styled to stand out visually from the rest of the pageâ€™s content and can contain a concise heading, sentence and action component such as a [willow-button](../button).

A banner spans the full width of the screen/viewport. It cannot contain multiple columns. The banner component can have a background image set by the developer. If one is not set a fallback color will be displayed.

  </ul>
</section>

## Elements

### willow-banner

- Required
- Restrictions
  - Should Contain: **willow-banner** elements

#### _Notes_

- The use of `role="region"` with the `<section>` element ensures that **willow-banner** is accessible for user agents that do not support HTML5. The use of both `<section>` and `<role="region">` together may create a warning in an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) but we left this pattern intact for now to cover all of our accessibility bases.
- To include a background image on **willow-banner** you will need to target the banner in your SCSS/CSS and set the `background-image` property. If you use the `.willow-banner` class, you will be targeting all banners on the site, so be sure to be more specific by adding your own class to the **willow-banner** component.
