# **Willow-Banner**

[Demo](https://unumux.github.io/willow-testing-site/)

A banner is a highlighted area of a page used to call out a single piece of information or action. This area is typically styled to stand out visually from the rest of the pageâ€™s content and can contain a concise heading, sentence and action component such as a [willow-button](../button).

A banner's background spans the full width of the screen/viewport while its content is restricted to the width of the `.container-fluid`. It cannot contain multiple columns. The banner component has a default background color but this color can be updated by a developer either by updating the `$component-banner-background-color` variable (which will update all banner backgrounds), or by adding a unique class name to the banner and adding new styling.

    </div>

## Elements

### willow-banner

- Required
- Restrictions
  - Should Contain: the Bootstrap `.container-fluid` element

#### _Notes_

- The use of `role="region"` with the `<section>` element ensures that **willow-banner** is accessible for user agents that do not support HTML5. The use of both `<section>` and `<role="region">` together may create a warning in an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) but we left this pattern intact for now to cover all of our accessibility bases.
- To change the background-color on **all** banners you can set the `$component-banner-background-color` variable to a new color value. If you want to change the color for just one or a few banners you can add a unique class to each banner and style the `background-color` property for that class.
