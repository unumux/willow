# **Willow-Banner**

[Demo](https://unumux.github.io/willow-testing-site/components/banner.html)

A banner is a highlighted area of a page used to call out a single piece of information or action. This area is typically styled to stand out visually from the rest of the pageâ€™s content and can contain a concise heading, sentence and action component such as a [willow-button](../button).

A banner's background spans the full width of the screen/viewport while its content is restricted to the width of the `.container-fluid`. It cannot contain multiple columns. The banner component has a default background color but this color can be updated by a developer either by updating the `$component-banner-background-color` variable (which will update all banner backgrounds), or by adding a unique class name to the banner and adding new styling.

## Elements

### willow-banner

- Required
- Restrictions
  - Should Contain: the Bootstrap `.container-fluid` element

#### _Notes_

- The use of `role="region"` with the `<section>` element ensures that **willow-banner** is accessible for user agents that do not support HTML5. The use of both `<section>` and `<role="region">` together may create a warning in an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) but we left this pattern intact for now to cover all of our accessibility bases.
- To change the background-color on **all** banners you can set the `$component-banner-background-color` variable to a new color value. If you want to change the color for just one or a few banners you can add a unique class to each banner and style the `background-color` property for that class.

### container-fluid

- Required
- Restrictions
  - Should Contain: **willow-banner** elements

#### _Notes_

- The `container-fluid` class from Bootstrap is used within **willow-banner** to restrict the width of the component's content while allowing styles applied to the main **willow-banner** block to span the full-width of the [willow-page-container](../page-container) component.

---

### willow-banner__icon

- Optional
- Restrictions
  - Should Contain: Nothing

#### _Notes_

- To include an icon image in **willow-banner__icon** you will need to add your own class to the element and target that in your SCSS/CSS and set the `background-image` property. Adding a new class allows the icon to be different on each banner. If you set the background image using the `.willow-banner__icon` class every banner on your site will have the same icon.
- Additionally, if your icon is populated dynamically via a CMS, you can use a style attribute to set the icon. This can be done in this way: `<div class="willow-banner__icon" style="background-image: url(...)"></div>`

---

### willow-banner__heading

- Required
- Restrictions
  - Should Contain: text

#### _Notes_

- To hide the **willow-banner__heading** add the `sr-only` utility class to the element
