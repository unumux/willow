## Introduction

**Willow** is a library of reusable user interface components built with front-end code (HTML and SCSS) to allow for faster, more consistent product development.

The library consists of semantic and accessible markup for a variety of components that can be paired with your own custom theme or a provided [theme](#available-themes) to give components a consistent and branded appearance.

### **Willow** is...

- written to meet UnumUX [CSS/SCSS](https://unumux.github.io/enterprise-css-standards/index.html) and [Accessibility](https://unumux.github.io/enterprise-accessibility-standards/) Standards
- influenced by the principles of:
  - [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) : small, independent - atomic - parts, can be combined into larger molecular structures. Molecular structures can be combined into larger organisms, which can then serve as the foundation for templates and full pages
  - [BEM](http://getbem.com) : a naming convention that makes front-end code easier to read, understand, work with, maintain and scale

### Browser Support

Willow is built to work with modern browsers

- Internet Explorer 10, 11 and Edge
- Chrome, Safari, Firefox
